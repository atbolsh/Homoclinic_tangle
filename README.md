# Homoclinic_tangle
#
# Code and some results.
#
#
# Original code from Daniel Garrett, althought it underwent heavy surgery.
# 
# Most of my significant contributions are in HW1_additions.
#
# Specifically, the "rescale" function preserves resolution, 
# and the 'active region' saves memory by only iterating enough points not to
# overlap with previously computed material.
# 
# 
# The easiest way to use this code is to run kplot, followed by plt.show()
# 
# The highest resolution diagrams here are generated by
#          
#          kplot(1.5, 22, 50, 0.0001, '-')
